   A Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on a node/slave (e.g. build server). Think
of an executor as a single “process ID”, or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins executes on your machine to run a
build. 

   it is recommended to allocate executors to slave machines, rather than on the Jenkins master - to avoid potential security 
   vulnerabilities, Out-Of-Memory and other performance issues.
   
   To do this, configure the “# of executors” to ‘0’ on the “master” node (by default this setting is ‘2’)
