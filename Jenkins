   A Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on a node/slave (e.g. build server). Think
of an executor as a single “process ID”, or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins executes on your machine to run a
build. 

   it is recommended to allocate executors to slave machines, rather than on the Jenkins master - to avoid potential security 
   vulnerabilities, Out-Of-Memory and other performance issues.
   
   To do this, configure the “# of executors” to ‘0’ on the “master” node (by default this setting is ‘2’)

2> Install jenkins plugin:
       GUI: Manage Plugin
       Command: install_plugin.sh
       
   Install Jenkins Plugin Offline: 
      1> Download plugin*.hpi from website, upload to jenkins master and deploy.
      2> Download plugin*.hpi from website, call install_plugin.sh to install.
      Notes: for performance concern, create a Generic Repository for Jenkins Plugin
      
      [Directly copy *.hpi to plugin folder and restart won't work, but *.jpi do works]
      
    Backup Plugin Folder & Restore:
    1> Backup the plugin folder of an running jenkins master and copy to new install, then all plugin are installed automatically.
   
   Notes: please pay attention to dependencies, offline install won't install the dependent plugins
