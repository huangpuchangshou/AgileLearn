   A Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on a node/slave (e.g. build server). Think
of an executor as a single “process ID”, or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins executes on your machine to run a
build. 

   it is recommended to allocate executors to slave machines, rather than on the Jenkins master - to avoid potential security 
   vulnerabilities, Out-Of-Memory and other performance issues.
   
   To do this, configure the “# of executors” to ‘0’ on the “master” node (by default this setting is ‘2’)

2> Install jenkins plugin:
       GUI: Manage Plugin
       Command: install_plugin.sh
       
   Install Jenkins Plugin Offline: 
      1> Download plugin *.hpi/*.jpi from website, upload to jenkins master and deploy.
      2> Download plugin *.hpi/*.jpi from website, call install_plugin.sh to install.
      Notes: for performance concern, create a Generic Repository at JFrog Artifactory for Jenkins Plugin
      
      [Directly copy *.hpi/old version/ to plugin folder and restart won't work, but *.jpi do works]
     
     
    Backup Plugin Folder & Restore:
    1> Backup the plugin folder of an running jenkins master and copy/unzip to new installed jenkins master, then all plugin are 
    installed automatically.
   
   Notes: please pay attention to dependencies, offline install won't install the dependent plugins
   
   https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker: install with a file & dedicated version: [e.g.] github-branch-source:1.8
 
  *hpi is old format, *jpi is new format.
   
  
 3> Custom Update Center
   You can custom your plugin update center. 
   1. CloudBees JOC has the plugin to setup your Jenkins Master as the Update Center.
   2. OpenSource: https://github.com/ikedam/backend-update-center2/wiki/How-to-create-your-own-Jenkins-Update-Center
